Prompt: Create pytest test scripts for my Flask website that has a database-driven projects page

Reply: I'll inspect the existing test files to see coverage and then add/modify pytest tests to exercise the Flask app routes and database functions. I'll read test_database.py and test_projects.py to avoid duplicates. After that I'll add tests that use Flask's test client and a temporary SQLite DB to keep tests isolated. Expected outcome: new/updated tests in the repo.

Read test_database.py

Read test_projects.py

I'll add pytest tests:

tests/test_dal.py: tests for DAL.init_db(), add_project(), get_projects() using a temporary file (tmp_path).
tests/test_app.py: tests for Flask app routes using app.test_client(), with an isolated DB path configured by monkeypatching DAL.DB_PATH or setting env var and calling init_db to ensure test DB used.
I'll create a pytest fixture that creates a temp DB and patches DAL.DB_PATH and DAL.get_connection or uses a temp copy. Then run tests locally is expected but I can't run them here unless asked; I'll add tests only.

Created test_dal.py

Now I'll create tests for the Flask app: start with a fixture that creates a tmp DB, monkeypatch DAL.DB_PATH or patch DAL.init_db to use the temp DB, then use app.test_client to request /projects and /project-form and POST an uploaded file using Werkzeug's FileStorage. I'll create tests/test_app.py.

Created test_app.py

I'll create a requirements/test dependencies file requirements-dev.txt listing pytest and pillow for test convenience and update the todo list.

Created requirements-dev.txt

Created 8 todos

I added pytest tests and a dev requirements file:

Files added

test_dal.py — tests DAL.init_db, add_project, get_projects using a temporary SQLite file.
test_app.py — uses Flask test client and a temp DB to test /projects and uploading a project with an image.
requirements-dev.txt — lists pytest and Pillow so you can run tests locally.
Notes and next steps

To run tests locally, create/activate your venv and install the dev requirements:
The tests use PIL to construct an in-memory PNG. If Pillow isn't installed in your test environment, install it (requirements-dev.txt includes it).
test_app.py patches DAL.DB_PATH to a temp DB so tests won't modify your real projects.db. It uses Flask's test client to make requests; if your app.py imports DAL.init_db() at module import time, the monkeypatch in the fixture still ensures DAL.DB_PATH points to the temp file before calling DAL.init_db() there.
If any test fails in your environment, paste the pytest output and I’ll iterate quickly.
